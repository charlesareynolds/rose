-- Provides routines that prefix the output with the name of the current

-- Note:
-- If this is instantiated multiple times inside nested declarative regions
-- (e.g. nested subprograms) and the resulting package is "use"d, then calls on
-- Log, etc. in the inner regions will be ambiguious and will not compile.
-- Solution: Prefix the call with the instantiated package name.
-- Solution 2: Put the "use" statement at the bottom of its declarative region.
